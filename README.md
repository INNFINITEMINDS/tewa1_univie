\* This course received a commendation award from the [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS)](https://improvingpsych.org/mission/awards/).

## Contents
* Computational modeling and mathematical modeling provide an insightful quantitative framework that allows researchers to inspect latent processes and to understand hidden mechanisms. Hence, computational modeling has gained increasing attention in many areas of cognitive science and neuroscience (hence, cognitive modeling). One illustration of this trend is the growing popularity of Bayesian approaches to cognitive modeling. To this aim, this course teaches the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to perform, evaluate and interpret Bayesian modeling analyses. 
* This course is dedicated to introducing students to the basic knowledge of Bayesian statistics as well as basic techniques of Bayesian cognitive modeling. We will use R/RStudio and a newly developed statistical computing language - [Stan](mc-stan.org) to perform Bayesian analyses, ranging from simple binomial model and linear regression model to more complex hierarchical models.
